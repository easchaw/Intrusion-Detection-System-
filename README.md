This work describes a computational efficient anomaly based intrusion detection system based on Recurrent Neural Networks.
Using Gated Recurrent Units rather than the normal LSTM networks it is possible to obtain a set of comparable results with reduced training
times. The incorporation of stacked CNNs with GRUs leads to improved anomaly IDS. Intrusion Detection is based on determining the probability of a particular call sequence occurring from a language model trained on normal call sequences from the ADFA Data set of system call
traces . Sequences with a low probability of occurring are classified as an anomaly.
